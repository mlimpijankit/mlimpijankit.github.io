## About Me

Hi 👋! I am a first-year Computer Science PhD student in the NLP lab at Columbia University under Prof. [Kathy McKeown](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~kathy/). 

I was previously a data scientist at IBM 👁 🐝 Ⓜ️ for 2 years, working on applied AI/NLP in the [Expert Labs](https://www.ibm.com/products/expertlabs) group. Before that, I received my BS in Computer Science from Columbia SEAS'23 🦁, where I researched computational methods (CV, NLP) for studying news media with Prof. [John R. Kender](https://www.cs.columbia.edu/~jrk/).

## Research Interests

- **Interpretability for VLMs:** concept decomposition, attention-based attribution, vision token analysis
- **Explainability Evaluation**: evaluation metrics for explanations, plausibility-faithfulness tradeoffs
